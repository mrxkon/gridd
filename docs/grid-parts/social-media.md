In the “Social Media Links” control you can click on the “Add Icon” button to add new icons.

To edit an icon you have added click on its title and it will expand allowing you to choose the icon that will be used, and type the URL of your profile.

You can add as many icons as you want, delete them, and sort them with a simple drag-n-drop.

Similarly to the size slider, using the “Padding” slider you can change the padding of your icons.

This will have an effect on how large the clickable area for icons is, as well as the distance between icons.
