# Content

The "Content" grid-part is where the main contents of your pages get rendered and cannot be removed from your main grid. The options available for the content area are:

## Max-Width

Defines the maximum width for your content. We recomment you use a value that corresponds to approximately 45-60 characters per line, as that size has been proven to make content consumption easier when it comes to content. To make that easier, you can use `em` values, so something like `50em` would be appropriate for most text-based scenarios.

## Container Padding

Use this setting to add some extra space above, below or on the sides on your main content area.

## Background Color

Use this setting to change the background-color of your main content area. The text colors will automatically change to ensure maximum contrast and readability according to the WCAG standards. [Gridd Plus](https://wplemon.com/gridd-plus) users can change and customize text & headers colors in the [typography section](https://wplemon.github.io/gridd/customizer-sections/typography.html#text--headers-colors) settings.
